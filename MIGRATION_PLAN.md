# Migration Plan: Create React App to Vite + React Router

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for migrating our application from Create React App (CRA) to Vite, and adding React Router for routing.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Create new branch `migrate-to-vite`
- [x] Remove CRA dependencies (`react-scripts`)
- [x] Add Vite and related dependencies:
  - `vite`
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  - `@types/react-router-dom`
  - `react-router-dom`

### 2. Configuration Files
- [x] Create `vite.config.ts` with necessary plugins and settings
- [x] Update `tsconfig.json` for Vite compatibility
- [x] Move and update environment variables to use Vite's `VITE_` prefix
- [x] Update `package.json` scripts:
  - Replace `react-scripts start` with `vite`
  - Replace `react-scripts build` with `vite build`
  - Update test configuration
- [x] Remove CRA-specific configurations (like `eslintConfig`)

### 3. Project Structure
- [x] Move `index.html` from `public/` to root directory
- [x] Update `index.html` template for Vite:
  - Add entry point script
  - Update asset references
  - Remove CRA-specific elements
- [ ] Update static asset imports in code to use Vite's conventions
- [ ] Set up proper file extensions (`.tsx` for React components)

### 4. React Router Setup
- [x] Create router configuration
- [x] Set up main routes
- [x] Implement route components
- [ ] Add navigation components

### 5. Code Updates
- [x] Update import statements for assets
- [x] Update environment variable usage to use `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
- [x] Fix any TypeScript errors that arise
- [x] Update any CRA-specific code patterns

### 6. Testing and Verification
- [x] Test development server
- [x] Test production build
- [x] Verify all routes work correctly
- [x] Check all assets are loading properly
- [x] Verify environment variables are working
- [ ] Test deployment process

## Progress Notes

### 2025-02-09

- Removed react-scripts and added Vite dependencies
- Created vite.config.ts with React plugin and basic configuration
- Updated package.json scripts for Vite and removed CRA-specific configurations
- Updated tsconfig.json for Vite and created tsconfig.node.json
- Moved index.html to root and updated for Vite
- Updated environment variables to use VITE_ prefix
- Set up basic React Router configuration
- Updated environment variable usage in App.tsx to use import.meta.env
